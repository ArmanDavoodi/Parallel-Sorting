This Repository is my final project for SBU(Shahid Beheshti University) concurrent programming course(OpenMP and CUDA).
 > Instructor: Dr. Mahmood Fazlali

 > Spring 2022


## Overview

In this project, sevral different sorting algorithms are implemented using C++. Some of these algorithmes are also parallelized using OpenMP and CUDA libraries. The efficiency of all of these implementations are compared and the results are available in the report.
